    <p>
      Zero Hunger Connect is a platform that bridges the gap between restaurants with surplus food and people who need affordable meals. Our mission is to reduce food waste and combat hunger by allowing restaurants to list unsold food items at lower prices for nearby customers to purchase and enjoy.
    </p>
    <p>
      We believe in community, sustainability, and a world where no good food goes to waste. Join us in our mission to feed people and protect the planet.
